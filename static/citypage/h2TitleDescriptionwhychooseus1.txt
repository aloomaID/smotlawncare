These herbicides create a barrier that prevents weed seeds from germinating. Apply them in early spring or fall, depending on the weeds you are targeting. For persistent weeds, spot-treat with post-emergent herbicides, focusing on areas where weeds have already emerged.<br>Regular lawn aeration is also beneficial. Aerating your lawn reduces soil compaction, allowing air, water, and nutrients to penetrate deeply and strengthen grass roots. This helps grass grow thicker and more robust, reducing the likelihood of weeds taking hold.<br>By implementing these strategies, you can keep your lawn in [placeholder7] looking vibrant and weed-free.
